Language model: course 5, vocab difference
Reduce learning rate and train a little more (after unfreezed training)
data_lm.show_batch()
Discriminative learning rate is crucial

Semi-supervised learning
We can fit more epochs without overfitting when we have more data
Half precision training: .to_fp16(), may increase speed by 8-10 times

Train both forward and backward LM and classifier and ensemble average the classifier prediction results
